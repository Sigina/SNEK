                <p> At SNEK.GG, we provide Malaysian’s hidden young talents the best quality gear that they could ever have into their dream gaming arsenal. 
                    As a local gaming gear distributor in Malaysia, we wanted our young HARIMAUs to shine brightly in the gaming industry, 
                    bringing pride and making history for the country. We should show the world that anyone could be a professional esports player no matter their races, 
                    skin colours or where they come from.
                </p>
                
                <p>Andrew Khong Weng Keong, also known as “KAZE”, 
                    is one of Malaysian’s top esports player who represented our country to compete in a well known Esports title, 
                    Counter Strike: Global Offensive or also known as CSGO by most of us. 
                    He is also the only Malaysian to compete in CSGO's world class event such as IEM or also known Intel Extreme Masters CSGO Event.
                    although he is not as well known as other pro players, but he will always be our Malaysia's pride.
